			<p>Ok, so I'm gonna try to write <i>something</i> for every day of 2026. I'll probably fail due to responsibilities, but even if I do I'll just keep going. Doesn't really matter if I get every day or not, but it would be cool! It's getting late, so I'll have to do the styling for this site tomorrow. As of writing it's plain HTML (._.), which isn't exactly optimal. Good night!</p>
